# PolitiPic

### Description 

A django app which provides a framework to study the relationship between an individual's face and their political opinions. Currently available at [gordons.byteprojects.co](http://gordons.byteprojects.co)

We used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Javascript, Bootstrap, Django, Google's Vision Api, and a number of other technologies to create an innovative project relevent to the highly politicized moment. We make the argument that the partisan divides in modern America are a result of social forces and do not reflect inherent differences between how people view the world. To put it plainly, the research and our personal experience suggests that people's votes are more directly influced by their neighbors than their actual beliefs.

With this in mind, we created an application that attempts to cut away at the partisanship and understand one fundimental dimension that research shows may hold the key to understanding the American electorate - biology. In the case of PolitiPic, a user is able to submit a photo of themselves and is given an estimate of where we think they exist on a political spectrum. This stands as a proof of concept that could be expanded to revolutionize the way campaigns reach out to voters. This is especially relevent in a world where a person's face is so widely available through the growing ubiquity of social media. To sum up, PolitiPic is an ambitious project that uses a wide range of technologies in an inovative way.
